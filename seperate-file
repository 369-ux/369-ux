Explanation
Initialization:
The Agent class is initialized with attributes for knowledge base, goals, values, emotional state, conscience, intrinsic motivation, memory, and internal dialogue.
Act Method:
The act method updates the agent’s knowledge, evaluates motivations, sets priorities, chooses an action, updates the emotional state, reflects on the action, and stores the experience in memory.
Activate/Deactivate Methods:
Methods to activate and deactivate the agent.
Knowledge Update:
The update_knowledge method updates the agent’s knowledge base with new perceptions.
Set Priorities:
The set_priorities method sets the agent’s goals based on its motivations.
Choose Action:
The choose_action method selects an action based on the agent’s goals and provides reasoning

Explanation
Initialization:
The Agent class is initialized with attributes for knowledge base, goals, values, emotional state, conscience, intrinsic motivation, memory, and internal dialogue.
Act Method:
The act method updates the agent’s knowledge, evaluates motivations, sets priorities, chooses an action, updates the emotional state, reflects on the action, and stores the experience in memory.
Activate/Deactivate Methods:
Methods to activate and deactivate the agent.
Knowledge Update:
The update_knowledge method updates the agent’s knowledge base with new perceptions.
Set Priorities:
The set_priorities method sets the agent’s goals based on its motivations.
Choose Action:
The choose_action method selects an action based on the agent’s goals and
